It adds a 'recuperation' verb, which sucks up an exhausted ability card and spits out a refreshed version after some time. I THINK it prioritises the oldest cards on the board when it has to choose, but I am not sure on that.\nThis makes your ability cards more valuable as resources, it might also make the game a little harder and slower though.",
